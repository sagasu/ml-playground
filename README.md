Machine learning playground

conda's sklearn package is called scikit-learn.  

you will need:  
`conda install scikit-learn`
`conda install quandl`
`conda install pandas`


# using COLAB Google

You don't need to have python and it's dependencies installed, you can use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) which provides an environment where you can upload jupyter notebook and data files and run the code directly there. Or if you don't have notebook just copy paste code from here and upload data file and run it.
# neural-network folder
Tensorflow version in conda is really old (1.*), consider installing one using pip:
`pip install tensorflow`
should install as for today tensorflow > 2.6

It holds simple ANN - artificial neural network example with some data to run it.
